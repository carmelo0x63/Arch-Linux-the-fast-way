# Arch-Linux-the-fast-way
Arch Linux, the fast way. A concise, streamlined set of instruction to install Arch Linux in just a few minutes.

----

I find [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) a wonderful distribution with a complex and structured [philosophy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux). It comes with an extremely complete [documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and a very active and passionate community exist.<br/>

Lots of information are available, _for those who have the time to search them_.<br/>

I felt the need to distil my own minimalistic steps to [install Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) to avoid hopping from one wiki article to another whenever (it happens often) I want to start from scratch.<br/>
